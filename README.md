# RAG-with-LangChain-and-Hugging-Face

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and the Mistral-7B-Instruct model. The implementation shows how to create a question-answering system that retrieves relevant information from a webpage about Eren Yeager (an anime character from Attack on Titan) and generates answers using a large language model.You can view and run the notebook on kaggle through [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/beasttitan/rag-with-langchain-hugging-face).
